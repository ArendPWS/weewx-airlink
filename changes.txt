Switch to US EPA correction for PM2.5.  This correction is
always applied.  The US EPA correction is meant for PurpleAir sensors,
but (anecdotally), AirLink tracks well to PurpleAir sensors.
Remove LRAPA and UNBC corrections.

Note: It is not possible to store the raw PM2.5 value and apply the
US EPA correction using xtypes.  The reason for this is because
the US EPA formula requires relative humidity and temperature AS
MEASURED BY the AirLink device.  These measurements are not avaible
in the database.  Supporting conversion on the fly would require
adding columns to the WeeWX archive table or require a separate
database.  A key feature of this extension is that it does not
require either of these.
